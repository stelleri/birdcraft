        BirdCraft is a semi-vanilla Minecraft SMP on Purpur 1.19.0. We are a group of Minecrafters who play games together, share life stories, hang out in voice chat, and foster a strong community vibe that we are increasingly proud of.
        <br><br>
        We are a 21+ community, so adults can be adults, and everyone is free to be themselves. Once you are a member, you can invite your friends, family, strangers, all are welcome assuming they are of age and follow the rules.
        <br><br>      
        We play with some QOL plugins and datapacks (click here for a full list) and we allow the use of client-side mods, so long as they don't constitute as cheating (click here for the official server-approved mod-pack).
        <br><br>
        The server is community supported, and nobody earns a profit. All money contributed through donations go directly towards server fees (click here to contribute).
        <br><br>
        Events are held monthly, we have a few going on now, click here to view the calendar!
        <br><br>
        We also have an Ark:Survival Evolved server now!
        <br><br>
        Join now through the application on our Discord! We can't wait to play with you, and get to know you. If you are looking for Minecraft friends, BirdCraft is right for you!
